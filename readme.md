*This is only for local and dev purpose, no authentication and only JS not TS, just for fun in my local*

I created a bot for my wife to let him doing transaction and remind her to write the expense in WhatsApp by utilizing Whatsapp Web JS + n8n.

In this case, I create a group called 'Manage Money', the member only me and my wife. my account will be used as the AI but I still can write or ask anything to the group.
